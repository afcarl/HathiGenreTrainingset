HathiTrust training
===================

This repo currently includes Python scripts that I’m using to munge page-level training data for a project, “Understanding Genre in a Collection of a Million Volumes.”

The actual classification scripts (in Java) are in [a different repo, intuitively named pages.](https://github.com/tedunderwood/pages)

The subdirectory /olddata also includes older training data I used for an earlier volume-level classification project.
